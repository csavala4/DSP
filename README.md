# DSP

This project is mean to analyze and solve the exercies from the "Think DSP: Digital Signal Processing in Python, by Allen B. Downey."
Some of the files may be copied from his repository. The credit goes to him and anyone else contributing to his repository.  

The solutions to exercies however, will be organic from myself and any other contributors. This project is based on familiarazing contributors and myself with a programmatic approach to signal processing.
